## Difficulty Levels
### Easy
Player is given a target of 10 to make addition. He has to make a score of 35 by making up the addition and shooting enemies in order to bump to next level.

### Medium
Player is given target of 50 to make addition. He has to make a score of 150 by making up the addition and shooting enemies in order to bump into next level.

### Hard
This is most difficult level to crack. Player is given target of 500 to achieve. The action that happens on collecting a number is not fixed to addition as with the previous levels. When player collects a numbered box, it may add up, subtract, multiply or divide the current score, thus making the game more difficult.
